Explanation of the structure:

public/: Contains static assets like HTML files. The index.html file is the main entry point for your app.
src/: The main source code directory.
assets/: Holds your static assets like images, styles, and fonts.
components/: Contains reusable Vue components. Organize them by functionality.
common/: Components used across the app (e.g., header, footer).
product/: Components related to products (e.g., product list, product card).
views/: Represents the pages of your app. Each view corresponds to a route.
store/: Houses your Vuex store for state management.
index.js: Initializes the Vuex store and combines modules.
modules/: Divides the store into smaller, manageable modules.
router/: Manages your Vue Router configuration.
index.js: Sets up your routes and their corresponding components.
App.vue: The root component that wraps your entire app.
main.js: The entry point where you instantiate your Vue app and import required plugins.
tests/: Contains your test files.
node_modules/: Contains the installed npm packages.
package.json: Lists your project's dependencies and scripts.
README.md: Documentation for your project.
This structure promotes the separation of concerns and modularity. Vue Router is used for managing routes, Vuex for state management, and components are organized for reusability. Remember, this structure can be adjusted based on your project's specific needs and preferences.
